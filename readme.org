This is a system status bar indicator (system tray icon) which indicates the strength of your internet connection, for when the weakest hop in the connection isn't the Wifi or bluetooth link to your computer.

I wrote this script because I often work on a shuttle bus, connected to the internet via mobile tether or the shuttle's Wifi. A large portion of my day-to-day work is done over an ssh session, so whenever the mobile connection drops or is slow, I'm forced pass the time by doing some other work that dosn't require a persistent high-quality connection (email, facebook, etc). Once the connection is back, I usually want to flip back into the work I was doing on ssh.

The problem with this work-flow has been that there is no cue to tell me when the connection is back with enough quality for me to return to the ssh work. Since the bad connection is between a cell tower and my phone/the shuttle's bridge rather than my laptop directly, there's no nice system status bar (system tray) icon like there is for Wifi or Bluetooth signal strength. Since it won't have access to the actual signal strength info, this script cannot be as accurate as those indicators, so it instead summarizes basic ping statistics (round trip and loss ratio to google.com) which should be primarily affected by the worst hop in the connection (the mobile link).
